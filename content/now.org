** Adevent of Code
It's December so it's [[https://adventofcode.com/][Advent of Code]] time. Here's [[https://github.com/rollacaster/advent-of-code][my repo]] with all Solutions in Clojure. This year I am trying out [[https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk][Clerk]], trying to make use of ad hoc visualizations for my code.
** Dev Widgets
As any other UI developer at some point in life I dream of creating a [[http://worrydream.com/][Bret Victor]] Style development environment for myself. [[https://github.com/rollacaster/dev-widgets][Dev Widgets]] is my attempt in doing that. (Not sure about the name yet)
** Learn in public
I did not add any content to this website in the last couple of months plan to change that. I never did a write-up of my [[https://github.com/rollacaster/GrootLapse][Grootlapse]] project. It's in heavy use right now time to catch up on that.
