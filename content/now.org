* Contributing to Open Source in Clojure
I started to contribute to [[https://cljdoc.org/][cljdoc]]. I am leveling my Clojure skills by doing so. I am proud of some minor additions I finished and excited for my future contributions.
* Learning Datomic
My grocery application [[https://github.com/rollacaster/shopping-cards][shopping-cards]] is turning into a playground to explore new technologies for me. After adding re-frame to the Frontend, I am migrating the data from files to [[https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/dev-local.html][Datomic Local Dev]].
* Generative art
For my 30th birthday, I got an Axidraw. I am using it to stick little pieces of art all over my office. I have completed five so far and hope to fill the entire wall.
* Reading!
At the end of last year, I started to read Structure and interpretation of computer programs. I try to solve each exercise for 30 minutes. I make slow progress, but progress.
