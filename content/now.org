** Leveling up shopping cards
There's a new type of web apps on the rise. All updates happen optimistically, collaboration is possible and works offline. I want to dig into this trend. I'll try to level up my side project [[https://github.com/rollacaster/shopping-cards][shopping-cards]]. I plan to add a [[https://github.com/tonsky/datascript][DataScript]]/[[https://www.datomic.com/][Datomic]] sync mechanism and offline support to explore this space.
** Math & algorithms
It always felt like an area of programming I neglected a little bit. So I bought the [[https://pimbook.org/][pimbook]] to start with some math and hope to brush up my skills.
** Learn in public
I did not add any content to this website in the last couple of months plan to change that. I never did a write-up of my [[https://github.com/rollacaster/GrootLapse][Grootlapse]] project. It's in heavy use right now time to catch up on that.
