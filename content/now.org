** Rewriting my website
After adding a mobile menu was quite challenging in the old architecture, I overhauled my website. Instead of [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html][org publish]] it's using a [[https://github.com/rollacaster/thomas-sojka.tech][custom solution]] now. It might still look the same but under the hood, everything changed. I have many more changes planned soon. Org-mode is still the basis for my blog.
** Joined Pitch
In December I switched jobs and now I work for [[https://pitch.com/][Pitch]]. I love it so far and  I can work full time with Clojure ðŸŽ‰. It's also my first remote job, everything went smoother than expected.
** Epic React Course
I work through the [[https://epicreact.dev/][Epic React Course]]. I spend 30 mins on that every day, to finish it step by step at a sustainable pace.
