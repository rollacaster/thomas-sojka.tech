** The Journey
My wife and I embarked on a 6-month journey. We spent 6 weeks in the US and are currently in Ecuador. It's our first time engaging in long-term travel, and it has been overwhelming thus far. I had hoped to dedicate more time to reading and writing, but most of my time has been devoted to improving our travel skills. Efficiently living out of a backpack, navigating from one place to another, and ensuring our safety in a country far more dangerous than our home country have proven to be time-consuming and stressful. However, I feel like we have overcome the most challenging part of adaptation and are starting to enjoy the trip much more.
 ** CSS Grids
I have largely overlooked CSS Grids as a layout technology, but I have always wanted to add it to my repertoire. I am starting to grasp its principles and gaining a better understanding of when to utilize it. Currently, I am summarizing everything I have learned about it.
 ** 3D Landing Page
I am currently working on a whimsical landing page featuring a timer that counts down to the days until my niece is born. It bears resemblance to the homepage of this site, so I believe it's time to create an abstraction for it, which I hope to share soon.
