#+TITLE: Introducing elcontext

#+SETUPFILE: ~/.emacs.d/org-templates/publish-defaults.org

I have just finished my first elisp package [[https://github.com/rollacaster/elcontext][elcontext]]. It introduces context based actions for Emacs.

* Context based actions

:END:
A context-based action is an Emacs command called under certain conditions. These conditions can include the current time (similar to a [[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron][cron job]]), the current folder and the current GPS location (available only for macOS).

* My use case

:END:
The original reason to create elcontext was to setup my development environment depending on my current location (e.g. workplace, home). I use [[https://github.com/rejeep/prodigy.el][prodigy]] to define services I need and elcontext starts them.

A new context is created interactively by using abo-abo’s fantastic [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]] package:

If a part of a context is omitted this part is always valid e.g. no location means anywhere, no time means anytime. Each command is triggered once a day.

I used Emacs’ [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Tabulated-List-Mode.html][Tabulated List mode]] to get an overview of all created contexts. Triggered contexts are highlighted in green:

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt A list of contexts

All context data is stored in hash tables which can be created or accessed conveniently with [[https://github.com/Wilfred/ht.el][ht]] and the GPS coordinates are retrieved via [[https://github.com/purcell/osx-location][osx-location]].

I am proud I finished my first Emacs package and happy to share it with you. If you consider elcontext helpful I would be pleased to [[https://github.com/rollacaster/elcontext/issues][hear about your use cases]].
