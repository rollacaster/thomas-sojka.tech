[[file:intro.png]]

Last week my first =elisp= package [[file:elcontext.org][elcontext]] was published on [[https://melpa.org/#/elcontext][melpa]]. It was the first time I have published a non-=JavaScript= package. Now I would like to share the differences between the =elisp= and the =JavaScript= ecosystem I experienced.

** Learning elisp

The first step for creating a package is obviously to learn =elisp=. Resources which helped me were the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/index.html][Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp]], the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/index.html][Emacs Lisp Reference Manual]] and [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp.html][Practical Emacs Lisp]]. A big difference to my usual =JavaScript= development experience was Emacs’ built-in help system. I discovered many useful =elisp= snippets in other packages by browsing through their help buffers and sources. It is important to know many =elisp= packages and to learn from their code since there are fewer online resources about =elisp= compared to =JavaScript=.

Writing lisp was intimidating at first but [[https://melpa.org/#/paredit][paredit]] was a great help to stay sane with hordes of parentheses. The [[http://danmidwood.com/content/2014/11/21/animated-paredit.html][Animated Guide to Paredit]] and [[http://emacsrocks.com/e14.html][Emacs Rocks!]] are great introductions for paredit. Today I cannot imagine writing any code (including =JavaScript=) without slurping & barfing.

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt The MELPA Logo

After writing [[file:elcontext.org][elcontext]] I published it on [[https://melpa.org/#/][melpa]] which is elisp’s equivalent to [[https://www.npmjs.com/][npm]]. Instead of a one simple =npm publish= you have to perform several steps for melpa. First, you need to use [[https://github.com/purcell/package-lint][package-lint]] which informs you about common issues of your package. Then, you must run =M x checkdoc= which verifies a consistent usage of documentation strings. The steps before opening a PR to melpa are to ensure your code byte-compiles cleanly and to test whether you are able to install your package by using melpa locally. Now you can create a recipe that looks similar to this one:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(elcontext :repo "rollacaster/elcontext"
           :fetcher github)
#+END_SRC

After submitting your PR, melpa’s maintainers review your code and suggest some improvements. I learned a lot about =elisp= by applying the reviews’ comments and I checked [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pulls][some other PRs]] on melpa to learn even more.

Adding a package to melpa is definitely more work compared to npm but I am also much more confident about the quality of my package.

** Conclusion

Getting out of my usual =JavaScript= development was a valuable lesson. Looking at other programming languages and communities seems to be one of the fastest ways to evolve as a programmer. I hope I will be doing this at least once a year.
