** New Job
Last week, I started my new job at Griffin, a bank in London. New beginnings are always exciting, and I have a long learning list to understand the new domain and technologies I am working with now. It's also a return to the technology I enjoy the most, and I am really happy to work with Clojure full-time again.
** Finding Balance
After a month of traveling through Spain and visiting my first music festival, I am working on getting back to my learning and sports routines.
** Books
I finished reading "The 1-Page Marketing Plan" and now have a better understanding of what marketing actually means on a high level. The next book, which I am close to finishing, is "Million Dollar Weekend," which explains how to start a new business. I am still continuing to read "SICP."
