** Going freelance
Once, freelancing was a distant dream, twinkling on the horizon. Now it's a bold reality beyond the mountain of paperwork that's currently my Everest. I'm almost there, ready to plant my flag and embark on my next adventure!
** Cloud computing
Getting proficient at cloud computing is my missing piece of expertise across the entire application development spectrum. I am currently focusing on improving my skills in technologies such as AWS, Terraform, and Ansible, not just as individual tools, but as integral pieces of a larger puzzle. This knowledge is crucial for me to provide a comprehensive service â€“ from building robust, cloud-based backends to meticulously designing engaging frontends.
** Books
I believe that my journey towards improving my skills is not something I should do alone, but rather, it should be an adventure shared with others. That's why I join book clubs with my friends, where we read and discuss books. Right now it's 'Modern Software Engineering', 'Terraform Up & Running', and 'SICP'. These sessions make reading an interactive and exciting experience, as we collectively learn from each other and from the books we read.
