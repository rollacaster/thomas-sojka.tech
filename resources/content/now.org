** The Journey
The journey is over, and after six months of traveling, I am back in Munich, returning to a normal life, which still feels quite strange. Nevertheless, it's great to meet up with all the people I haven't seen in the last six months.
** Balanced learning
Lately, I've been making a conscious effort to be more intentional about how I spend my learning time. I aim to strike a balance between working on a side project (porting [[https://github.com/rollacaster/shopping-cards][shopping-cards]] from a local Datomic to Firebase), reviewing code written by others (currently [[https://github.com/logseq/logseq][logseq]]), and revisiting some foundational concepts (currently calculus).
** Job Hunting
As I transition back to a normal routine, a crucial aspect involves searching for a job. If you're interested in collaborating with me, feel free to reach out at contact (at) thomas-sojka.tech.
