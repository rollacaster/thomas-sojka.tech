** Freelancing
Previously, freelancing was a distant dream, but after my journey, I have decided to make it a reality. It currently involves a lot of paperwork. But I am looking forward to tackling my first projects soon.
** Cloud Computing
Professional cloud computing skills are the missing piece of expertise for me. Currently, I am focused on improving my skills in technologies such as AWS, Terraform, and CDK. This knowledge is crucial for me to offer comprehensive servicesâ€” from building robust, cloud-based backends to carefully designing appealing frontends.
** Books
I have developed a slight addiction to book clubs and am currently reading 'Modern Software Engineering,' 'Terraform Up & Running,' and 'SICP.' Reading together as a group immensely helps in getting through a book, even when it gets challenging.
